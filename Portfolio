<body>
<p> Hi my name is Aldo and im a 2nd year student at Sno Isle Skills tech center. Im currently enrolled in the Video Game Design program and learning about blender and VR. As a 2nd year I am able to help other 1st year students with many problems they encounter. Over the the last year I have built up a portfolio of various games and projects.
<p></p> At my time in Sno Isle I have worked mostly in Unity and C# but also have gained some experience in Godot, GDScript, and Blender. I experience working both in 2D and 3D housing most of my projects on GitHub.
